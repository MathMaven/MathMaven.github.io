<problem>
<p>	
下列句子中，每句或真或假：<br>
1）这些句子中刚好有一句为假。<br>
2）这些句子中刚好有两句为假。<br>
3）这些句子中刚好有三句为假。<br>
4）这些句子中刚好有四句为假。<br>
5）这些句子中刚好有五句为假。<br>
那句是真？哪句是假？<br>
</P>
<p>
Each of the following statements is either true or false.<br>
1) Exactly one of these statements is false.<br>
2) Exactly two of these statements are false.<br>
3) Exactly three of these statements are false.<br>
4) Exactly four of these statements are false.<br>
5) Exactly five of these statements are false.<br>
Which of these statements are true, and which are false?<br>
</p>

</problem>



### Solution <button>Show / Hide</button>


<solution>

五句话互不相容，最多有一句是对的。五句话全假也不行，因为那样就符合第五句，第五句就是对的，自相矛盾。因此一句为真，四句为假。所以第四句是真，其余都为假。<br><br>
The 5 statements are mutually contradictory, so at most one is true. It is not possible that all 5 are false, because that would have made Statement 5 true, a contradiction. So exactly one statement is true and all other four are false. This means Statement 4 is true, and everything else is false.

</solution>
