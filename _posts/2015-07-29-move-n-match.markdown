On the table, an equation is formed with matches in Roman numerals: <br><br>
XI + I = X
<br><br>
meaning 11 + 1 = 10, which is wrong. At least how many matches should be moved to make the equation correct?

<solution>
Zero. Go to the opposite side of the table, the equation becomes X = I + IX.
</solution>
