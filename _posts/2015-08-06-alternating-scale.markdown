Given a standard balance and weights of 1g, 2g, ……Ng, one of each. Place the weights on the two pans of the balance, so that the right side is heavier than the left side. Take one weight away from the right side, then the left side becomes heavier. Then take another weight away from the left side and the right side is heavier again. Keep going such that at each step one weight is taken from the heavier side and the balance reverses, equality never occurring, until only one weight remains. Find all possible weights that can be the last one. If necessary, express in terms of N.
