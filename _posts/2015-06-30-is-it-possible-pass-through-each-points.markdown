<problem>
<p>	
立方体的顶点和各面的中心共14个点。一只蚂蚁从其中一点出发，只沿着各面的对角线爬，能否经过每个点恰好一次（最后不必回到起点）？若能，画出路径；若不能，说明理由。
</P>
<p>

On a cube, consider the 14 points including the vertices and the centers of the faces. If an ant starts from one of these points, crawling only along the face diagonals, is it possible for it to pass through each of these points exactly once (it is not required to return to the starting point at the end)? If so, draw the path; if not, explain why.
