小安正在学习分数。有两道分数化简的题目，她是这样做的：把16/64中分子和分母的“6”消去，得1/4；把19/95中分子和分母的“9”消去，得1/5。虽然方法错了，但是结果居然是对的！你还能找出另一个可以用类似办法“化简”的分数（分子分母都是两位数）吗？你能找出两个吗？

Ann was learning fractions. She "simplified" two fractions as follows: for 16/64, she canceled the "6" from the numerator and the denominator to get 1/4; for 19/95, she canceled the "9" to get 1/5. Both happened to be right, although the method was wrong. Can you find another fraction (numerator and denominator are both 2-digit numbers) that can be "simplified" like that? Can you find two?
