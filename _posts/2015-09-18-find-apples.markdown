Ming went to the Farmer's Market to sell apples. The first buyer bought half of Ming's apples plus half an apple; the second buyer bought 1/3 of the remaining apples plus 1/3 of an apple; the third buyer bought 1/4 of the then remaining apples plus 1/4 of an apple. All apples were sold in whole without being cut. At the end Ming had 2 apples left. How many apples did Ming have at the beginning?

<solution>
$$ x-(x/2+1/2)=y $$

$$  y-(y/3+1/3)=z $$ 

$$  z-(z/4+1/4)=2 $$ 

$$  z=3, y=5, x=11 $$
