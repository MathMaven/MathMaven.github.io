<problem>
<p>	
“7-11”小敏在7-11便利店买东西，挑了四件货物去收银台结账。正好收银机坏了，收银员小姐用计算器算账，得出\$7.11。小敏注意到收银员是把四个价格乘起来了，所以就提醒她算错了。收银员小姐重新算，把四个价格加起来，结果还是\$7.11。假定没有购物税。问：这四样东西的价格分别是多少？
</P>
<p>
Min picked up four items at a 7-11 convenient store, and brought them to the cashier. The cash register was broken, and the cashier girl had to use a calculator to find the amount, which came out as \$7.11. Min noticed that the girl was multiplying the 4 prices, and told the girl that she made an error. The cashier girl calculated the total amount again by adding the 4 prices, and it turned out to be \$7.11 again. Assume there is no sales tax. What are the prices of the four items?
